# Brain

Beginning attempts at creating a digital brain by simulating biological neurons.

###Neurons###

Biological neurons feature a build-up of charge and fire at certain threshold.
Firing neurons are strengthened, while unused neurons waste away.
Neurons also feature charge decay - they don't hold charge forever.

I've attempted to simulate all of these features in my digital nueron class design.

###They Actually Solve Problems###

I've used these neurons to solve some simple problems like OpenAI's [CartPole](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0).
My work with OpenAI's Gym environments can be found [here](https://github.com/SealedSaint/openai-gym).

#####This is just the building block#####

*Really all that's here is a class design, which isn't much. A single nueron does not make a brain.
The key is in combining and connecting the neurons in the right way.*

*Nevertheless, having the proper building block is crucial.*
